## 💡 What Is a Pre-Fire Tool in Blood Strike?

A **Pre-Fire Tool** is a cheat system that combines **Wallhack (ESP)** with a **Triggerbot** or **Silent Aim**, allowing you to shoot the **millisecond an enemy becomes visible**. It's designed for tight angles, door holds, stair pushes — any scenario where being *first* equals being alive.

This tool doesn’t just react. It **predicts**, **lines up**, and **executes** — all faster than your opponent can blink.
